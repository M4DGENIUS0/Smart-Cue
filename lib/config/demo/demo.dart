const demo_script = """Hi everyone! Today, I’m excited to show you Smart Cue, 
    a powerful teleprompter app designed to make your video recordings, presentations, and speeches smoother and more professional. Whether you’re a content creator, public speaker, or just someone who wants to nail their next presentation, this app has got you covered. Let’s dive in! 
    First, let’s open the app. As you can see, the interface is clean and intuitive. The main screen gives you quick access to start a new script, open a saved one, or adjust settings. Let’s start by creating a new script.
    To add your script, simply tap the ‘New Script’ button. You can either type directly into the app or paste text from another source. For this demo, I’ve prepared a short script about the benefits of using a teleprompter. Here’s what it looks like:"

    Read the script aloud as it scrolls
    Using a teleprompter can help you deliver your message clearly and confidently. It ensures you stay on track, reduces the need for retakes, and makes you look like a pro!
    One of the key features of this app is the ability to control the scrolling speed. If the text is moving too fast or too slow, you can adjust it with this slider. Watch how the speed changes as I move it:

    Demonstrate slowing down and speeding up the text
    Perfect! You can set the speed to match your natural speaking pace.
    Next, let’s talk about customization. If the text is too small or hard to read, you can easily increase the font size. You can also change the text color and background for better visibility. For example, let’s switch to a larger font and a high-contrast color scheme.
    Now the text is much easier to read, even from a distance.
    Once you’re done with your script, you can save it for future use. You can also export it as a text file or share it with others. Let’s save this demo script as ‘Teleprompter Benefits.
    Thanks for watching this demo! If you have any questions or want to learn more, feel free to reach out. Happy scripting!
